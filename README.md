# Guobaplay

A Discord music bot written in Rust using Serenity and Songbird. A lot of this is built off of the examples in the Songbird repository so FULL credit to them on that.

Dockerfile currently doesn't work, but you can compile and use the binary in a service file!

There's honestly not really a reason to use this in a Dockerfile since it's just a running binary with streaming data. But since some of you are Docker fiends or have setups that only use Docker I'll be working on that.
